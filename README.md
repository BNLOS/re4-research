# re4-research
Various modding tools & research for Resident Evil 4.

* **re4lfs.cpp** - (un)packer for RE4 LFS files, allowing you to compress your modded RE4 data to as little as 5% the size in best case!

* **re4sym.cpp** - parser for SYM files included with the RE4 GC debug build, allows exporting the SYM as both IDA & Ghidra scripts

* **prodg-rel.py** - IDAPython loader for PS2 "SN ProDG relocatable DLL" files, as used by the RE4 PS2 versions, will automatically name functions with whatever symbols are available in the REL.

More tools may be added later on, who knows.
